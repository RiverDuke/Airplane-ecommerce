      Trump paid $1.8mn in federal income tax for the six years between 2015 and
      2020, as he declared $53mn in net losses over the period spanning his 2016
      campaign for the White House and the bulk of his term as US president. The
      details of Trump’s tax payments came in a summary of his tax returns
      released by the Democratic-led US House ways and means committee this week
      after four years of legal wrangling. The panel is expected to publish full
      redacted versions of Trump’s tax returns in the coming days. The summary,
      which was compiled by Congress’s non-partisan Joint Committee on Taxation,
      showed Trump declared no taxable income for 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2020,
      years in which he racked up $82mn in combined losses. The two years for
      which he reported taxable income were 2018 and 2019, with adjusted gross
      income of nearly $29mn. The documents show the extent to which Trump
      aggressively used tax deductions and reported losses in order to lower his
      tax bill at the height of his political career and his public service. The
      JCT said it had “no opinion” on whether the former president should have
      paid more or less tax than he actually did during those years, but it
      noted a series of items on Trump’s tax returns. Among them were interest
      income from related-party loans made to some of Trump’s children,
      including Ivanka Trump, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. The JCT said these
      raised “the question of whether the loans were bona fide arms lengths
      transactions or whether the transfers were disguised gifts that could
      trigger gift tax and a disallowance of interest deductions by the related
      borrowers”. Like many real estate developers, Trump’s business is
      structured through tax-exempt “pass-through” vehicles where ultimate tax
      is paid on his personal returns submitted to the Internal Revenue Service.
      The report noted the majority of the Trump vehicles in some years reported
      “either no gross income (ie only expenses), or gross income and expenses
      that entirely offset, raising the questions of whether these were valid
      trade or business activities, or whether these schedules contained costs
      derived from personal activities or hobbies.” Richard Neal, the Democratic
      chair of the ways and means committee, has justified his pursuit and
      release of Trump’s tax returns on the grounds that the IRS failed to
      perform a mandatory audit of the ex-president’s tax returns while was in
      the White House. “For four years, the committee has been reviewing how the
      IRS enforces the federal tax laws against, and ensures compliance by, a
      president,” he said on Tuesday night. “A president is no ordinary
      taxpayer. They hold power and influence unlike any other American. And
      with great power comes even greater responsibility,” he added. But
      Republicans have lashed out at the publication of the tax returns as
      politically motivated. “I am deeply concerned by recent erosions of
      taxpayer confidentiality and the dangerous precedent today’s release sets,
      which undermines confidence in both our tax laws and legislature,” Mike
      Crapo, the top Republican on the Senate finance committee, said on
      Wednesday.
